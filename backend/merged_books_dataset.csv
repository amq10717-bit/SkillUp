Structured and Object-oriented Problem Solving Using C++,Andrew C. Staugaard,,2002,"""Welcome to the third edition of my C++ text. The highly successful first edition was one of the first textbooks available for teaching C++ in the first programming course. The text was introduced at the 1994 ACM Conference in Phoenix when many were arguing the virtues of teaching C++ and OOP versus Pascal and structured programming in the first programming course. I argued at the time, and still argue, that students need to be taught problem solving early-on using both the structured and object-oriented paradigms and, because of its hybrid nature, C++ is the only language suited to learning both of these paradigms.

Object-oriented Analysis and Design with Applications,Grady Booch,Addison-Wesley Professional,1994,"This revision of Grady Booch's classic offers the first industry-wide standard for notation in developing large scale object-oriented systems. Laying the groundwork for the development of complex systems based on the object model, the author works in C++ to provide five fully-developed design examples, along with many smaller applications. Three of these capstone projects are new with this edition, including an inventory tracking system which implements a client server. The other four span problem domains as diverse as data acquisition for scientific tools, framework, artificial intelligence, and command and control. To measure progress, metrics in object development are suggested so that the developer knows how the project is going. In addition, the author demonstrates good and bad object designs and shows how to manage the trade-offs in complex systems.",618,Business & Economics,en,,,3.0,1,Google Books,,OOP,OOP,object oriented analysis design,2025-09-24,,,

JavaScript Object Programming,Martin Rinehart,Apress,2015-12-30,"This brief book explains the advantages of the object model, inheritance, both classical and prototypical, and shows how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance. This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP ""capabilities"" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript's inheritance have not done it justice.

Computational Contact Mechanics,"Alexander Konyukhov, Karl Schweizerhof",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-08-14,"This book contains a systematical analysis of geometrical situations leading to contact pairs -- point-to-surface, surface-to-surface, point-to-curve, curve-to-curve and curve-to-surface. Each contact pair is inherited with a special coordinate system based on its geometrical properties such as a Gaussian surface coordinate system or a Serret-Frenet curve coordinate system. The formulation in a covariant form allows in a straightforward fashion to consider various constitutive relations for a certain pair such as anisotropy for both frictional and structural parts. Then standard methods well known in computational contact mechanics such as penalty, Lagrange multiplier methods, combination of both and others are formulated in these coordinate systems. Such formulations require then the powerful apparatus of differential geometry of surfaces and curves as well as of convex analysis. The final goals of such transformations are then ready-for-implementation numerical algorithms within the ",454,Science,en,3642315313,9783642315312.0,0.0,0,Google Books,Geometrically Exact Theory for Arbitrary Shaped Bodies,DSA,DSA,introduction to algorithms CLRS,2025-09-24,,,

They embed the design and implementation of data structures into the practice of sound software design principles that are introduced early and reinforced by 20 case studies. Data structures are introduced in the C++ STL format whenever possible. Each new data structure is introduced by describing its interface in the STL. Next, one or two simpler applications are discussed then the data structure is implemented following the interface previously introduced. Finally, additional advanced applications are covered in the case studies, and the cases use the STL. In the implementation of each data structure, the authors encourage students to perform a thorough analysis of the design approach and expected performance before actually undertaking detailed design and implementation.

Algorithm Engineering,"Matthias Müller-Hannemann, Stefan Schirra",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-08-05,"Algorithms are essential building blocks of computer applications. However, advancements in computer hardware, which render traditional computer models more and more unrealistic, and an ever increasing demand for efficient solution to actual real world problems have led to a rising gap between classical algorithm theory and algorithmics in practice. The emerging discipline of Algorithm Engineering aims at bridging this gap. Driven by concrete applications, Algorithm Engineering complements theory by the benefits of experimentation and puts equal emphasis on all aspects arising during a cyclic solution process ranging from realistic modeling, design, analysis, robust and efficient implementations to careful experiments. This tutorial - outcome of a GI-Dagstuhl Seminar held in Dagstuhl Castle in September 2006 - covers the essential aspects of this process in ten chapters on basic ideas, modeling and design issues, analysis of algorithms, realistic computer models, implementation aspects",527,Computers,en,3642148654,9783642148651.0,0.0,0,Google Books,Bridging the Gap Between Algorithm Theory and Practice,DSA,DSA,algorithms design analysis,2025-09-24,,,

One approach to meeting the performance requirements of the applications has been to utilize the most powerful single-processor system that is available. When such a system does not provide the performance requirements, pipelined and parallel process ing structures can be employed. The concept of parallel processing is a depar ture from sequential processing. In sequential computation one processor is in volved and performs one operation at a time. On the other hand, in parallel computation several processors cooperate to solve a problem, which reduces computing time because several operations can be carried out simultaneously.

A task that would take hours can be completed in virtually no time by using a few lines of code in a modern scripting program. This book offers an introduction to algorithms through the real-world problems they solve. The algorithms are presented in pseudocode and can readily be implemented in a computer language. The book presents algorithms simply and accessibly, without overwhelming readers or insulting their intelligence. Readers should be comfortable with mathematical fundamentals and ha",527,Computers,en,0262035707,9780262035705.0,0.0,0,Google Books,A Beginner's Guide,DSA,DSA,algorithm design manual,2025-09-24,,,

Distributed Graph Analytics,"Unnikrishnan Cheramangalath, Rupesh Nasre, Y. N. Srikant",Springer Nature,2020-04-17,"This book brings together two important trends: graph algorithms and high-performance computing. Efficient and scalable execution of graph processing applications in data or network analysis requires innovations at multiple levels: algorithms, associated data structures, their implementation and tuning to a particular hardware. Further, programming languages and the associated compilers play a crucial role when it comes to automating efficient code generation for various architectures. This book discusses the essentials of all these aspects. The book is divided into three parts: programming, languages, and their compilation. The first part examines the manual parallelization of graph algorithms, revealing various parallelization patterns encountered, especially when dealing with graphs. The second part uses these patterns to provide language constructs that allow a graph algorithm to be specified. Programmers can work with these language constructs without worrying about their implemen",213,Computers,en,3030418863,9783030418861.0,0.0,0,Google Books,"Programming, Languages, and Their Compilation",DSA,DSA,graph algorithms programming,2025-09-24,,,

Tree-based Graph Partitioning Constraint,Xavier Lorca,John Wiley & Sons,2013-01-24,"Combinatorial problems based on graph partitioning enable us to mathematically represent and model many practical applications. Mission planning and the routing problems occurring in logistics perfectly illustrate two such examples. Nevertheless, these problems are not based on the same partitioning pattern: generally, patterns like cycles, paths, or trees are distinguished. Moreover, the practical applications are often not limited to theoretical problems like the Hamiltonian path problem, or K-node disjoint path problems. Indeed, they usually combine the graph partitioning problem with several restrictions related to the topology of nodes and arcs. The diversity of implied constraints in real-life applications is a practical limit to the resolution of such problems by approaches considering the partitioning problem independently from each additional restriction. This book focuses on constraint satisfaction problems related to tree partitioning problems enriched by several additional ",130,Mathematics,en,1118603605,9781118603604.0,0.0,0,Google Books,,DSA,DSA,graph algorithms programming,2025-09-24,,,

Algorithms,M. H. Alsuwaiyel,World Scientific,2016,"""Problem solving is an essential part of every scientific discipline. It has two components: (1) problem identification and formulation, and (2) the solution to the formulated problem. One can solve a problem on its own using ad hoc techniques or by following techniques that have produced efficient solutions to similar problems. This requires the understanding of various algorithm design techniques, how and when to use them to formulate solutions, and the context appropriate for each of them. Algorithms: Design Techniques and Analysis advocates the study of algorithm design by presenting the most useful techniques and illustrating them with numerous examples -- emphasizing on design techniques in problem solving rather than algorithms topics like searching and sorting. Algorithmic analysis in connection with example algorithms are explored in detail. Each technique or strategy is covered in its own chapter through numerous examples of problems and their algorithms.

Exact Exponential Algorithms,"Fedor V. Fomin, Dieter Kratsch",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-10-26,"For a long time computer scientists have distinguished between fast and slow algo rithms. Fast (or good) algorithms are the algorithms that run in polynomial time, which means that the number of steps required for the algorithm to solve a problem is bounded by some polynomial in the length of the input. All other algorithms are slow (or bad). The running time of slow algorithms is usually exponential. This book is about bad algorithms. There are several reasons why we are interested in exponential time algorithms. Most of us believe that there are many natural problems which cannot be solved by polynomial time algorithms. The most famous and oldest family of hard problems is the family of NP complete problems. Most likely there are no polynomial time al gorithms solving these hard problems and in the worst case scenario the exponential running time is unavoidable. Every combinatorial problem is solvable in ?nite time by enumerating all possi ble solutions, i. e. by brute force search.

A good choice of data structures will simplify your job, not complicate it. Your code will be not only faster but also easier to understand and debug. There is no downside to using the right data structures for the job. This book Provides an understanding of the fundamental building blocks of data structures Describes the construction and use of all common data structures Explains the simple math required for selecting efficient data structures Equips you with everything you need to choose data structur",170,Computers,en,1040367771,9781040367773.0,0.0,0,Google Books,,DSA,DSA,hash tables data structures,2025-09-24,,,

Automatic Programming Applied to VLSI CAD Software: A Case Study,"Dorothy E. Setliff, Rob A. Rutenbar",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book, and the research it describes, resulted from a simple observation we made sometime in 1986. Put simply, we noticed that many VLSI design tools looked ""alike"". That is, at least at the overall software architecture level, the algorithms and data structures required to solve problem X looked much like those required to solve problem X'. Unfortunately, this resemblance is often of little help in actually writing the software for problem X' given the software for problem X. In the VLSI CAD world, technology changes rapidly enough that design software must continually strive to keep up. And of course, VLSI design software, and engineering design software in general, is often exquisitely sensitive to some aspects of the domain (technology) in which it operates. Modest changes in functionality have an unfortunate tendency to require substantial (and time-consuming) internal software modifications. Now, observing that large engineering software systems are technology dependent is no",237,Technology & Engineering,en,1461315514,9781461315513.0,0.0,0,Google Books,,DSA,DSA,data structures implementation,2025-09-24,,,

Algorithmic Problem Solving,Wayne Ramirez,CreateSpace,2014-11-01,"Problem solving consists of using generic or ad hoc methods, in an orderly manner, for finding solutions to problems. Some of the problem-solving techniques developed and used in artificial intelligence, computer science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, etc. are related to mental problem-solving techniques studied in psychology. The term problem-solving is used in many disciplines, sometimes with different perspectives, and often with different terminologies. For instance, it is a mental process in psychology and a computerized process in computer science. Problems can also be classified into two different types (ill-defined and well-defined) from which appropriate solutions are to be made. Ill-defined problems are those that do not have clear goals, solution paths, or expected solution. Well-defined problems have specific goals, clearly defined solution paths, and clear expected solutions. These problems also allow for more initial planning than ill-defined problems.

For example, based on Euclid's algorithm, we derive a new and efficient algorithm to enumerate the positive rational numbers in two different ways, and we develop a new and constructive proof of the two-squares theorem.
